        //constraints together- like ball socket, swing limit, and revolute angular joint- and you wouldn't want to regather inertia and pose for all of them.
        //(In that specific case, using a simultaneously solved ball socket + revolute angular joint would be preferred for stability, but the point stands.)

        //There are very few cases where a combo constraint will have less than 3DOFs...)

            //The projection should strive to contain the smallest possible representation necessary for the constraint to work.

            //softenedEffectiveMass multiply due to the linear components. We can just store the raw angular jacobians and piggyback on the linear component effective mass multiply.

            //So, the question becomes... is there a way to bundle inverseInertia into the angularJacobians?
            //Yes, but it's not useful. If we premultiply the skew(offset) * inverseInertia for CSIToWSV, the result is no longer symmetric.
            //That means we would have to store 3 additional scalars per body compared to the symmetric inverse inertias. That's not particularly useful;

            //NOTE:
            //It's possible to use local inertia tensors diagonalized to only 3 scalars per body. Given that we load orientations as a part of the prestep and so could reconstruct 
            //the world inertia tensor, this would save 6 scalar loads. In isolation, that's a likely win. However, there are some other considerations:
            //1) Some common constraints, notably including the contact constraints, do not load pose. They can either load diagonalized inertia with orientation (7 total scalars per body)
            //or a symmetric world inertia tensor (6 scalars). Given the relatively high cost of incoherent gathers, the 6 scalar world inertia gather would be used.
            //2) If constraints are loading from both local and world inertias rather than one or the other, the number of cache misses increases.
            //3) It requires that the local space of shapes is aligned with the moments of inertia. While this could be done automatically when creating shapes, and while
            //all primitive shapes are built with diagonal inertia tensors, it is likely that the local 'reorientation' required by diagonalization applied to things like
            //convex hulls or meshes would be confusing for users. Recentering certainly was in V1.
            //4) It cannot be used to save space on explicitly stored inertias in constraints, because the warmstart/solve do not load the pose (and, as above, loading orientation and
            //local inertia is 1 scalar more than just the world inertia).
            //5) While the local diagonal representation does offer some possibilities for ALU-level optimizations in the prestep, the effective mass matrix will be in world space,
            //and in general it will not be any smaller than the usual symmetric representation.
